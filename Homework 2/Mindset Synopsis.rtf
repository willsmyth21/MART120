My mindset score was 49, suggesting I have a \'93strong growth mindset\'94. I always figured I had a mindset that liked to grow but at the same time had my doubts as I would come to certain failures in different things. Just recently I gained the confidence to pick up media arts as another major because it is something I have always been very interested in but never felt good enough at. However I began to understand that I can learn get better at different media arts, I am not going to just be born with this. Getting my results from this quiz was certainly a confidence booster going into the first semester of my sophomore year. }
