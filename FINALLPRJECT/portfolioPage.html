     <br>
     <br>
        This is a fun random math game, should not be too hard but good luck.

      This a self portait of myself, a bit abstract but its me! This was done by using p5 to draw shapes to create an image as one.

     <a href="codedrawingmove.html"> Cool drawing but now its moving!</a>
     <br>

     <br>



     This is the same self portait as the one above but this one moves! This was done very similarly as above but uses more variables and functions in the drawing to create moving parts.

     This a fun game where you can move around using w,s,a,d to reach the end. It also artistically is really interesting to look at. Feel free to click for a surprise. This was also drawn using p5 and uses a number of differnt loops and arrays to create what you are seeing.
